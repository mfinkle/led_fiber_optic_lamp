# LED Fiber Optic Lamp

Based on a design discovered on Instructables, this is the code for an LED fiber optic lamp. The lamp uses individually addressable WS2818 / NeoPixel strands and runs a set of different animation modes.

The initial version of the project uses a [Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500) using CircuitPython.
